Big Data
  Apache Spark/MLlib - Machine Learining for massive data sets.

Python
  Linear Algebra
    NumPy - efficient linear algebra library.
    SciPy - several other handy numerical libraries, including sparse matrix implementations.
  General Purpose
    scikit-learn - de facto default machine learning library in Python.
    StatsModels - focuses on statistics/econometrics instead of machine learning. Basically, R functionality for people who hate using R. Really great library.
    NLTK - a really handy library for natural language processing.
    gensim - super efficient/easy to use implementations of many common natural language processing models.
    PySCIPOpt - a Python interface for the SCIP Optimization Suite for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP).
  Deep Learning
    TensorFlow - the most famous (but not necessarily the best!) deep learning library; maintained by Google.
    Torch - another deep learning library; maintained by Facebook.
    PyTorch - Python implementation of Torch that uses mostly the same stuff under the hood as Torch. Enables dynamic neural networks.
  Theano - the OG Python deep learning library that embraced the computational graph paradigm; maintained by the Université de Montréal.
    Keras - an amazing library (recently absorbed into TensorFlow) for quickly developing deep learning models. TensorFlow et al. tend to be “lower level” and Keras abstracts away a lot of the overhead necessary for developing deep learning models. It’s also (mostly) backend agnostic with regards to Theano and TensorFlow.
    PyMC3 - Bayesian modeling with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference.
  Evolutionary Models
    DEAP - Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms
R
  Time Series Models
    forecast - the R package forecast provides methods and tools for displaying and analysing univariate time series forecasts including exponential smoothing via state space models and automatic ARIMA modelling.
    tseries - time series analysis and computational finance
    tsoutliers - This package implements a procedure based on the approach described in Chen and Liu (1993, doi:10.2307/2290724) for automatic detection of outliers in time series. Innovational outliers, additive outliers, level shifts, temporary changes and seasonal level shifts are considered.
    AnomalyDection - automatically detects anomalies like these in big data in a practical and robust way
    CasualImpact - implements an approach to estimating the causal effect of a designed intervention on a time series. For example, how many additional daily clicks were generated by an advertising campaign? Answering a question like this can be difficult when a randomized experiment is not available.
    prophet - Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data. It is based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly and weekly seasonality, plus holidays. It works best with daily periodicity data with at least one year of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data, shifts in the trend, and large outliers.
    hts - Methods for analysing and forecasting hierarchical and grouped time series. Forecasting hierarchical or grouped time series
  Linear Models (And Friends)
    glmnet - generalized linear models, ridge, lasso, and elastic net for high-dimensional, low-sample size data; dimensionality reduction and variable selection.
    lme4 - generalized linear models; random/fixed/mixed effect models for hierarchical data structure especially.
    survival - survival/longitudinal analysis, Cox model, etc.
    VIF -  Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) test in OLS.
    lmtest - test linear regression models.
    leaps - best subset in linear regression for variable selection.
    sem - structural equation models.
  Machine Learning
    caret - classification and regression.
    randomForest - random forests for classification and regression.
    penalizedLDA - penalized classification using Fisher's linear discriminant.
    penalizedSVM - feature selection for Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
    Boruta - all relevant feature selection wrapper algorithm; regression or classification. Includes “shadow” variables and evaluates variable importance (random forest by default), excludes poor variables, repeat, stop when all are confirmed or does not converge.

Scala
  Breeze - numerical/linear algebra/statistics library.

  Awesome Machine Learning - huge list of machine learning libraries.

Multi-language
  XGBoost - an extremely powerful implementation of gradient boosted machines that is frequently used tool by Kaggle competition winners. It almost always makes sense to use XGBoost as one of your baselines when optimizing machine learning models.
  Stan - a library for performing Bayesian inference.
